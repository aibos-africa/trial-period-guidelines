# Working Hours and Punctuality Guidelines

- Punctuality: Adhering to your schedule is critical to maintaining your reliability. We expect you to work according to the hours youâ€™ve registered. This includes not only avoiding tardiness but also ensuring that you don't significantly extend your scheduled working hours.
- Schedule Changes: If there are significant changes to your overall schedule for the following week, please notify us by Sunday.
- Urgent Matters: In case of urgent matters, please inform us the day before.

> **_NOTE:_** Each member has set specific working hours on their schedule, so it is important that you arrive at the office within those registered hours. Arriving late can not only slow down the progress of our projects but also impact your credibility as a professional and as a valued member of AIBOS. We place a strong emphasis on maintaining trust, and this plays a significant role in your performance evaluation.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
